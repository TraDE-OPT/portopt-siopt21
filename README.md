# Degenerate Preconditioned Proximal Point Algorithms: Example Code

This repository contains the experimental source code for computing an optimal solution to a regularized Markowitz portfolio optimization problem with transaction penalties with different operator splitting methods used for numerical comparisons in:
* K. Bredies, E. Chenchene, D. Lorenz, E. Naldi. Degenerate Preconditioned Proximal Point Algorithms. *SIAM J. Optim.* 2021 (in press). [ArXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11481)

To reproduce the results of the numerical experiment in Section 3.2, run:
```bash
python3 comparisons.py
```
Convergence plots are saved in the file `test2.pdf`.
